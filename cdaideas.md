__1):__ Find a way to display a possible correlation between abseentism and Louisville's open data on Health Inspection violations. If it doesn't correlate, possibly give information on local sickness spikes.

__2):__

***_Big ideas that I don't think are possible but are really cool nonetheless_***
*A: Find a dataset of local towings near Louisville, and display cars by their liscense plate to see if it was stolen, just towed, or otherwise.

*B: Find Medicare billing dataset (all procedures billed by all US physicians for Medicare) to create something useful for doctors and the like. An example of how this could be used is a doctor finding a location that best suits a patients surgical needs. Showing how much that location has practiced the service, survival potential, ratings, etc.

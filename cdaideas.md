Possible CDA Hackathon Ideas Regarding Safety
===============

__1):__ Find a way to display a possible correlation between abseentism and Louisville's open data on Health Inspection violations. If it doesn't correlate, possibly give information on local sickness spikes.

        • An opening for air quality app. Wink wink.

__2):__ Use the air quality dataset to provide a multi-platform service to notify users of air quality in the Louisville metro system. Platforms could be email, text, or fancier like the Amazon Echo.

        • There is an emergency alert API in beta with Louisville metro

__3):__ Create an application that lets users fill out a PDF to submit complaints to the Human Relations Commission([PDF](https://louisvilleky.gov/sites/default/files/human_relations/lmhrc_complaint_management_system_form.pdf))






Newest Datasets/Possible Datasets: LMPD Gun Intake,  Emergency Services, Firefight data,

Ideas involving the newer datasets:

__4):__ Create a 3d data visualization of the firefight data, possibly with clickable points explaining cause, and outcome.

__5):__ Some sort of application or skill that can email you the emergency broadcast, using the city ESA in text form

        • If made into a sort of Alexa skill, could possibly ask for the last emergency broadcast, too.

__6):__


***_Big ideas that I don't think are possible but are really cool nonetheless (not possible meaning that it isn't on the datasets, nor is it necessarily always local, were thought of)_***

•A: Find a dataset of local towings near Louisville, and display cars by their liscense plate to see if it was stolen, just towed, or otherwise.

•B: Find Medicare billing dataset (all procedures billed by all US physicians for Medicare) to create something useful for doctors and the like. An example of how this could be used is a doctor finding a location that best suits a patients surgical needs. Showing how much that location has practiced the service, survival potential, ratings, etc.
